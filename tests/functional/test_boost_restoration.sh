# Test: Policy Restoration After Boosting
# Verify stalld correctly restores original scheduling policies and priorities
# after boost duration expires.
#
# Note: starvation_gen creates SCHED_FIFO threads by default (blocker and blockees).
# Tests verify that SCHED_FIFO tasks are properly restored after boosting.
